This might \ntake you a long time, and you might make a few mistakes along the way. \nThis is a perfect task for a computer, which would be able to do it \nreally fast and without any mistakes. You can take advantage of this by \nusing loops. A loop is a block of code that will repeat over and over \nagain.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of loops, “while loops” and “for loops”. </span><span style=\"color: #43b02a;\"><b>While loops</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will repeat&nbsp;while a condition is true, and </span><span style=\"color: #43b02a;\"><b>for loops</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will repeat a certain number of times.
